# PM10 pollution in Friuli Venezia Giulia

The R code ([available here](https://github.com/daniloderosa/pm10-pollution-in-FVG/blob/main/inquinamento.R)) was written in January 2021 to analyze the PM10 pollution in Friuli Venezia Giulia, a region in the North-East of Italy. The results were analyzed in an article written for the _Messaggero Veneto_, a local newspaper. Here's the [link to the article](https://messaggeroveneto.gelocal.it/udine/cronaca/2021/01/29/news/in-aumento-nel-2020-i-giorni-di-superamento-delle-polveri-sottili-1.39836737), though I have to say that it's paywalled. 

Below you can find four charts that I've made for this project. The first one was made in R and refined in Illustrator, while the other 3 were made in Tableau (by clicking on each one of the three you'll be redirect to the _interactive_ version).
